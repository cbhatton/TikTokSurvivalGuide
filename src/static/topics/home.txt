In only the past 2 or three years Tik Tok has become a household name, It made people feel more connected but it has also stirred up it’s own fair share of controversy. Many of these being merited, Tik Tok can be addicting and toxic, it can be divisive, putting people in bubbles and echo chambers, and there is a fair amount evidence show that tik tok does not respect it’s users privacy.
But out of all of the criticism’s that can be levied against Tik Tok there is one that I won’t take. That Tik Tok lacks creativity or that it’s users aren’t creating genuine art. Defining “genuine art” is the topic of a whole philosophy paper (or maybe book) in its self so we will steer clear of that one. But as for creativity it doesn’t take much scrolling on to find that in it’s many facets, spread across Tik Toks vast network of culture and art. Every tik tok user lies somewhere in this “network” and if you were to look at any one persons tik tok you would get a vastly different experience.
One profile may be full of tone poems over beautiful footage of rainy days and friends hanging out. Others may consist of carefully fleshed out sketch comedy all written and performed by one person in their room. Music, fashion, film, philosophy, history and more all have their place on tik tok.

Although its clear to me that all of these thing are great, the problems that I raised at the beginning still remain, hence what we’ve created here: The Tik Tok Survival guide. Broken down into three of what we consider Tik Toks biggest issues, this guide is meant to give you some guidance in your use of the platform. If we’ve done our job correctly, people will have a way of using tik tok that takes all of the creativity, culture and community and throws out the division, endless scroll and existential dread.
