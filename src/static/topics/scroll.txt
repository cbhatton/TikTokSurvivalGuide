TikTok and Addiction

One of the hardest parts of using TikTok is putting down your phone. It almost seems that TikTok’s algorithm holds your interest to the point where you do not necessarily stay in one place, but keep scrolling for hours on end. While this can be a good thing for TikTok creators or TikTok itself through ad revenue, it is often detrimental to the user. Although TikToks are surely entertaining, they do not offer any physical or emotional health benefits (besides dopamine). Finding the balance between healthy TikTok use and mindless scrolling is one of the most important factors in learning to navigate the app.
So, we know that TikTok is addictive. But why is this so? The answer is a bit complicated, but here’s the gist of it: our brains develop social media addiction the same as they would develop a substance addiction. [1] When you scroll through TikTok and find something that brings you joy, laughter, or happiness, your brain is receiving a dopamine response. This incentivizes us to keep doing that activity so that we can receive more dopamine, also known as the pleasure chemical. Furthermore, according to Nir Eyal in his book “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products,” he states that most apps implement a model that is summarized in 4 steps. [2] The first step is a trigger, which is usually an app notification. Next is an action, such as using the app. After that, there is a variable reward for using the app, which I would say is dopamine from interacting and watching various TikToks. Finally, there is an investment in the app, which in other words means something meaningful that the user can put into the app to start the cycle again. I believe this is the ability to create and upload TikToks easily.
The best thing that we can do as responsible app-users is to self-reflect and realize how much time we are spending on our phones and scrolling TikTok. While TikTok itself does not have any warnings or gage of time spent, there are many apps and widgets to help with this. The best example of this is the screen-time setting on iPhones. There, users can select an app and put a daily limit on how much time they are allowed to spend per day. I have personally seen my friends use this method, and it seemed to work great. Besides limiting screen time inside of our phones, it is also a good and healthy practice to put away phones completely before sleeping or when going out to social events.

One question that remains is whether or not this form of app-engagement is ethical. While it certainly does keep users active and interacting with their application, is it too much? Blake Allen, from Berkeley University, says “I argue that addictive technology is manipulation, as it is hijacking internal reward systems in order to create a habitual activity which benefits a private company (ie: facebook, twitter, netflix, etc.).” [2] I have to say, I certainly agree with Blake here. When private companies create an app that is designed to keep you addicted, I would say there should at least be a feature to alert the user about how much time they are spending on the app. Furthermore, devetry.com suggests that companies be mindful of how frequently and for what purpose they are sending notifications to the user, as well as allowing them to change those settings within the comfort of the app. [4]
Encompassing all this information, it is clear to see that TikTok truly is addictive and that the creators behind it intended for this to be so. TikTok can be as addictive as substance abuse [1], so it is important for us to be wary and set limits on ourselves for how much time we pour into this app. Finally, I believe it is ethically wrong for TikTok to be employing this addictive model without at least bringing awareness to its users. I do not believe you should stop using TikTok, but keep an eye out for yourself.
