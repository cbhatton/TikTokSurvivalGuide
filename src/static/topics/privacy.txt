TikTok has had a fair number of security concerns come up during its relatively short lifespan. For one the app has been banned in multiple nations including Iran, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh for various reasons. For another in August 2020, the Trump administration moved to remove TikTok from the app store, due to concerns that the app might threaten the national security of the United States. This was blocked but in February of this year, the Biden administration is looking into the app considering possibly even a ban on the app altogether, if there is evidence that it is being used to steal user’s data.
Should the fact that this is a topic where Trump and Biden have similar views make people nervous that there is something to these claims of national security threats? Or are these just two old men who do not understand social media? Let’s take a deeper look into TikTok’s security.
So TikTok is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, because of this it is easy to scare people with the idea that the Chinese government is spying on us through TikTok, but is there any real evidence of that?
The nation does have laws which compel any private business within its borders to turn over data to the government upon request, so if user’s data was stored on Chinese servers the government could theoretically take it whenever it wants. ByteDance also had previously developed the app Douyin, which has been observed distributing data from users to multiple Chinese companies. So there are some definite red flags here.
Since those red flags do exist, many people have deeply looked into TikTok, and they have not found anything particularly concerning regarding measures of national security. The University of Toronto investigated the code in TikTok and found that although there is concerning code within Douyin, TikTok is entirely separate and does not share any of those concerns. While the app does collect some personal information from users it is nothing more significant than any other social media app. Lastly TikTok claims that all of their data on American users is stored on US soil and is inaccessible to the Chinese government. There is certainly a chance this is false but there is no evidence to suggest so and researchers have found that TikTok is not communicating with any servers based in China.
So it would seem there are no serious concerns of national security, but what about personal security. There is some history of TikTok having these issues, including when ByteDance agreed to pay $92 million to settle a class action lawsuit over data privacy claims in the US. TikTok also does distribute user information to a handful of other companies, including advertisers, in order to tailor ads to meet their users. In spite of this, researchers have concluded that TikTok does not pose a threat that is more significant than any other social media company.
So there is certainly some risk, but if you are okay with using Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, then you should be okay with using TikTok.
If you still have concerns over using TikTok for security reasons, there are some steps you can take to mitigate your own risk.
1. Do not give the app your real information: You can give a fake name/birthday and guarantee that information will never be distributed.
2. Set your account to private: If you go into Settings and hit Privacy there is an option to set your account to private.

As it says, this will prevent people from following your activity on the app without your permission. This is not the best advice if you’re looking to get rich on TikTok, but if security is your top concern, this is a good option.
3. Avoid giving any sensitive info: This is fairly obvious but if you have information that you wouldn’t want the whole world to know, don’t put it on the internet. This can include visual clues in videos that could lead people to your address or things like that. Don’t show a video of your paycheck and things like that. Also while there is no evidence of national security risks, if you have government secrets on your phone maybe play it safe and don’t get the app.
TikTok is not perfect when it comes to security, but nothing on the internet is, and according to experts it should be the least of our worries. This issue is on people’s radars enough that if legitimate concerns do arise, we will quickly know about them. As long as you are comfortable with most of the internet, you will be comfortable on TikTok.
